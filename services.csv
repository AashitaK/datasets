https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/course-mailing-lists/,Course Mailing Lists,"CIS provides several different methods for emailing the instructors and students in a particular course.
<a href=""http://groups.g.hmc.edu"">Google Groups
The <a href=""https://portal.hmc.edu"">HMC portal also includes a way for a faculty member to email all of the students in his/her class.
Sakai has an Email Archive tool which creates a mailing list.",Available to faculty and emeritus at HMC.,"You can see all of the course mailing lists that you are a member of by going to Google Groups and clicking the My Groups link. Google Groups has a web interface to your course mailing lists which makes it easy to add and remove members and view archived messages. Any email client may be used to send mail to a Google Group.  If you are a faculty member teaching a course, then you are the owner of the course list and can make changes to the default settings. The default settings for a course mailing list are:
Only members of the group can see the list of members.
The web archive of messages sent to the group is turned off.
Prospective members must ask the owner of the list to be able to join.
We also have a list of all automatically generated course mailing lists on Google Groups (HMC login is required).
The HMC portal allows you to view all of your students (with photos) and email the class. The portal functions more as a one way faculty to student broadcast system, in that the students cannot mail to the class list via the portal.
The Sakai Email Archive tool allows you to email students and keeps a convenient searchable and sortable archive of the messages on the Sakai site. You can set up an address of your choice for the list, and configure the tool to allow email from any address or keep it closed. You do not have to be in Sakai to send messages, but can use the email client of your choice. Although the Email Archive tool is not part of the default set up for a course site, it is very easy to add, and can easily be configured to suit your needs. Anyone you have included in the site (eg. as an auditor) will be included in the recipient list. Even if you don’t use Sakai for anything else, it is worth considering the Email Archive tool for communicating with your class.","<a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/sakai-support/"">Sakai Support</a>, <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/gsuite/"">HMC Google Workplace</a>, <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/google-groups-mailing-lists/"">Google Groups Mailing Lists</a>","<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16PrH0smdx8NJkno5OkWAEjnC5YPZIMLU5c237z4QJPA/edit?usp=sharing"">List of all automatically generated course mailing lists on Google Groups</a>, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6lHdJWQEjp7HMmP6xaFl6LlXrCFBCGFBZnH_OkWI64/pub"">FAQ for groups.g.hmc.edu (Google Groups)</a>, <a href=""https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/help/main"">Sakai Help</a>","CIS provides several different methods for emailing the instructors and students in a particular course.

With Google Groups, you can create online and email-based groups. There’s a lot you can do with Google Groups:
Engage in discussions about a specific subject.
Organize meetings, conferences, or social events among members of a group.
Find people with similar hobbies, interests, or backgrounds.
Read group posts through email, the online interface, or both.
You may also find the following videos helpful when getting started with Google Groups:

https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/encryption/,Hard Drive Encryption,"Hard drive encryption uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data on a hard drive. Data on an encrypted hard drive cannot be read by anyone who does not have access to the system, appropriate key, or password. It must be decrypted using that key or password to read encrypted data.
Encryption is best used on machines that can easily be lost or stolen, although there is no harm in encrypting all of your systems.
At HMC, CIS recommends encrypting your entire operating system volume through BitLocker for Windows computers, or FileVault for Apple computers. You will be given a unique recovery key during the encryption setup process. This key is needed to decrypt your hard drive if BitLocker or FileVault locks your system. BitLocker may activate on your system if there is an unexpected power outage, if you are replacing hardware components in your computer, or if you unplug your computer and move it to a different location.
In those scenarios, you will need the recovery key to decrypt your data. Please save your key somewhere safe (i.e., not on your computer). CIS recommends Google Drive, which is encrypted on Google’s servers, or any encrypted password manager, such as <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/lastpass/"">LastPass at HMC.","Available to faculty, students, and staff at HMC.","Configuration of these applications can vary from system to system, but at its simplest:

Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or higher

See <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MWw-VV-bGUYJ2_WtEzoWIz8rY55yYda58R8aog0sZbc/edit"">which services currently use HMC Credentials.
This represents a change in CIS communications and practices. Up to now, we have typically identified usernames and passwords by reference to the application or server which uses them, so we would often say things like “Google Apps username and password” or “LDAP username and password” and “Sakai username and password.” From now on, CIS will no longer refer to these local account credentials unless they are different from your HMC credentials.
Some of the services using HMC credentials can be accessed using Single Sign-On (SSO). For these services, such as G Suite and the Portal, you will only need to log in once to be able to access all other SSO services. See the list of Roles and Authorizations in the Related Links below to see which account types use which credentials.

At this point, you won’t be able to view the recorded videos without requesting a new video link from USS. Upon request, recordings can also be left on Mediasite for one additional semester. If you need a video hosted for more than two semesters, USS can work with you to preemptively transfer your video from Mediasite to Google Drive so that you can update your video links with no loss of hosting time.
Other features of Mediasite lecture capture include the ability to embed questions in a recording, quickly locate specific sections of a recording by searching text on slides, and a flexible player layout.",Available to faculty and staff at HMC. Students who require lecture capture for academic accommodations can reach out to the ADA/Title IX coordinator.,"Faculty can request lecture capture recording by using our AV Request Form or by sending an email to helpdesk@hmc.edu.

https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/online-form-builders/,Online Form Builders,"Online form builders allow the user to create and deliver web-based forms. Though there are a variety of free or paid tools for creating online forms, CIS supports two main platforms: Kuali and Google Forms (an application in Google Workplace). While these tools are approximately equivalent for simple applications such as satisfaction surveys or RSVP forms, we have specific recommendations based on the purpose and design of the form.
CIS offered a third party service called Formstack for fillable form creation, but it won’t be supported after August 2023. We are offering help in training and transferring forms from Formstack to Kuali for those that require it. Please contact the <a href=""mailto:helpdeck@hmc.edu"">helpdeck@hmc.edu to setup an appointment if needed.
In general, we recommend using Google Forms for simple or informal surveys on campus. These forms are fairly easy to build and distribute, and they have many of the same capabilities of Kuali. 
Easy/limited requirements = Google Forms
Medium = Kuali
Other = OnBase or Microsoft Forms
You should use Kuali when:
The form will display information from other HMC data sources
The form will require heavy use of form logic, i.e. changing the content or organization of the form depending on user responses
You should use Google Forms when:
The form will be fairly simple (no form logic or payment information required)
You want to edit the form collaboratively with other users
You want to limit form access to HMC users or record the HMC usernames of form respondents
If you are planning to use forms for formal academic research, it may be worth purchasing an account with Qualtrics or another survey tool provider. While CIS does not provide Qualtrics accounts, individuals or small groups may acquire these accounts independently. Please consult with the <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/institutional-research/about-the-office-of-institutional-research-and-effectiveness/"">Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness for further recommendations.
If you are using online forms to capture data that is FERPA protected, please be cognizant of how the data is stored and shared with other users.

The article <a href=""https://www.opendns.com/enterprise-security/threat-enforcement/"">Enterprise Threat Detection Like no Other has more information.
OpenDNS Umbrella works by examining requests from computers and other devices, determining if the requested site is in its database of known malicious sites and, if it is, redirecting to a benign web page. OpenDNS Umbrella does not capture information that is not already captured in router and switch logs. The kinds of problems it helps with include:
Botnets – software that makes your computer part of a “botnet” or network of computers that can be activated to attack other sites on the internet
Ransomware – a type of malware that encrypts the files on your computer and leaves a message offering to give you the key to decrypt the file in return for a sum of money. This kind of attack has been in the news lately, and HMC and the other Claremont Colleges have already been subject to Ransomware attacks.
Phishing – emails may contain requests for you to visit a site that contains malware, ransomware or botnet software. OpenDNS Umbrella prevents access to such sites.
‘Drive-by-download’ attacks – a malware delivery technique that is triggered simply because the user visited a website that contains codes delivered via content like banners or advertisements.

This link will change from time to time, so it’s best practice to use the link from your newest digest e-mail. You may also manage your “Safelist” and “Blocklist” when visiting your Quarantine.
Microsoft 365 places quarantined email in a folder called “Junk E-Mail” and Google Mail places it in a folder called “Spam.”

https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/wireless-networks/,Wireless Networks,"Claremont-WPA (HMC credentials or people from The Claremont Colleges)
Claremont-WPA is the preferred wireless network at HMC. Connecting to Claremont-WPA provides the benefits of WPA2-Enterprise security and allows for accessing most internal HMC resources. It requires authentication with your HMC credentials username followed by @hmc.edu and HMC credentials password upon connection.
For most devices, you should only need to enter your HMC username followed by @hmc.edu and your HMC password. If connecting to Claremont-WPA with an Android device, it may ask for additional information:
EAP method: PEAP
Phase 2 authentication: MSCHAPv2
System certificate: “Do not verify” or “Use system certificate”
Domain: hmc.edu
Identity: Your HMC username followed by @hmc.edu
Anonymous identity: Leave blank
Password: Your HMC password
Eduroam (guest network for people from other institutions)
Eduroam (education wireless roaming) allows users (researchers, teachers, students, staff) from participating institutions to securely access the Internet from any Eduroam-enabled institution. In other words, your HMC credentials will work at other institutions to get you access to secure wireless networks and other resources. It requires authentication with your HMC credentials username followed by @hmc.edu and HMC credentials password upon connection. If you are visiting from another campus, you will need to enter your home campus credentials.
The Eduroam principle is based on the fact that the user’s authentication is done by the user’s home institution, whereas the authorization decision allowing access to the network resources is done by the visited network. A full list of participating institutions can be found on <a href=""https://www.eduroam.us/institutions_list"">Eduroam’s website.
Claremont-ETC (older devices and guests who can’t use Eduroam)
The Claremont-ETC wireless network is designed for use by older devices that do not support WPA2-Enterprise authentication. The Claremont-ETC network is inherently less secure because it involves a shared password.  Do not use Claremont-ETC if you can use Claremont-WPA or Eduroam instead.
If you have HMC credentials and need to connect to Claremont-ETC please use our <a href=""https://forms.gle/RqcEGQQe44ecE7nBA"">Claremont-ETC Password Request form (you must be signed into your @g.hmc.edu to view it). If you don’t have HMC credentials please contact the CIS Help Desk to obtain the current password.","Claremont-WPA and Claremont-ETC are available to faculty, staff, students, emeritus, and trustees at HMC and all of The Claremont Colleges.
Eduroam is also available to all those previously listed as well as visitors from other institutions who have Eduroam configured at their home institution.
Guests who do not have access to Eduroam should contact the Help Desk for the Claremont-ETC password.","Access the appropriate wireless settings pane on the device to be connected and select the appropriate network for the use case. When prompted, enter the appropriate username and password.
Please contact the Help Desk at helpdesk@hmc.edu or 909.607.7777 to request assistance with connecting to wireless networks.

https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/wireless-projection/,Wireless Projection,"Wireless Projection allows a user to display content from their device, either a laptop or mobile device, to a projection or LCD screen without the use of cables. This allows the user to have the freedom to walk around a room or easily share screen access to other users in the room. As part of CIS’s continuing Wireless projection pilot, AppleTVs and Microsoft WiDi adapters are available in a few select rooms across campus to enable wireless projection. We’ve found that using both of these devices covers the vast majority of users and their devices.
The following rooms currently contain wireless project devices:
AppleTV (compatible with Apple devices):
Shanahan 2450
Shanahan 2454
Caryll Mudd Sprague Private Dining Room (Hoch-Shanahan)
Microsoft WiDi (compatible with Windows and Android devices):
Shanahan 2460
Janet &amp; Jeffery Mitchell ’79 Private Dining Room (Hoch-Shanahan)
The list is expected to grow, so be sure to check the current list of <a href=""http://goo.gl/4Mj1Nx"">AV Equipment in the HMC Class/Meeting Rooms page for up-to-date information on equipped rooms.
