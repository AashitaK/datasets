Academic Advisory System,"Academic Advisories are sent via email and automatically copied to the instructor, the student’s advisors, and the Office of Academic Affairs. The Academic Affairs Committee tracks all advisories and the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs will meet with any student who receives two or more advisories. While often used when there is a concern (e.g., missing paper/HW, poor attendance, or performance on the exam), advisories are also used to send encouraging notes (e.g., great improvement or performance on an exam). The advisory system is also an effective formal way to call a conference with the student."
Academic and Scientific Software Support,"CIS maintains campus-wide license agreements for popular academic software packages including MATLAB, Mathematica, Wolfram Alpha Pro, Maple and more. Installation and licensing information can be obtained by contacting the HMC Helpdesk. Users can install the software on their system or visit either of the CIS maintained computer labs in the LAC or Sprague first floor to use the software.
If you are taking a course at another campus and the professor is using software that HMC doesn’t license, the IT support group at that campus can help you obtain the software. Our HelpDesk can facilitate that request on your behalf if needed.
Additionally, the Academic &amp; Research Computing Services (ARCS) group provides technical and advisory support for the following scientific software:
Mathematical Software: MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, ODE Architect
Programming Software: Anaconda, Jupyter, Python packages
Statistical Software: R, RStudio, Tableau
Scientific and Engineering Software: COMSOL, Materials Studio, Gaussian, GROMACS
High Performance Computing Software/Library: MPI, OpenMP, GPGPU
We can also research new specialized (scientific) software on demand, and provide recommendations or “best effort” support on the selection and the use of new specialized software. We regularly provide seminars and workshops on some of the specialized scientific software."
Adobe Acrobat,"Acrobat Pro DC includes Acrobat desktop software, the Acrobat Reader mobile app enhanced with premium mobile features, and premium Adobe Acrobat online services. Some of these features include:

Adobe Sign
Our Acrobat Pro DC licensing includes <a href=""https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/signing-pdfs.html"">PDF and e-signing tools. However, this differs from <a href=""https://www.adobe.com/sign.html"">Acrobat Sign, a more robust e-signature service that allows users to send, sign, track, and manage signature processes using a browser or mobile device. We do not have the license for Acrobat Sign at this time."
Anki Flash Cards,"Anki is a free, open source application that allows you to create flash cards in order to quickly memorize information. Both a desktop and mobile versions are available. You can also create an account on the Anki website that allows you to synchronize your flashcards between your desktop and mobile apps.
At HMC, faculty are very interested in learning the names and faces of all of the students in their classes. In order to support that CIS creates an Anki flash card file that contains the names and faces of all current HMC students. The cards are also tagged with the students’ class year, major, advisors, and state/country of origin. We do not include tags for courses due to FERPA concerns, but faculty are free to add their own tags."
Audiovisual Event Support,"CIS provides AV support for classes, meetings, and events on the HMC campus. Please note that reserving a room for an event and requesting AV support are two separate requests. To reserve an event space, please use the <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Femsweb.claremont.edu%2FHMC%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzcPCBZhOiwHqkoaeksh8fSYjqPNcQ"">EMS website.

The series’ purpose is to foster innovation in the use of technology in teaching, learning, and research. Presentations are informal with plenty of time for discussion and Q&amp;A."
Canvas Support,"Canvas is the Course Management System being adopted by all of The Claremont Colleges over the next couple of years. All faculty and students teaching or enrolled in courses on Canvas have accounts on Canvas. Each college has their own instance of Canvas, but the colleges have implemented a Federated Trust between all of our instances of Canvas that allows users to see any courses they might be enrolled in at any of the other colleges from their home instance of Canvas. Please see <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTgMrNhWqMnEV6tqmR_xQr2V4f2RanhlBwBVK8R8aw-z0qOyilGX0AQ0834TbENqaRyngsfZvGPyxAp/pub"">Canvas at The Claremont Colleges for a list of all of the instances of Canvas at The Claremont Colleges. CIS provides support for Canvas including help with accounts and passwords as well consultation on how and when to use specific Canvas tools, help on how to use specific tools, and training on Canvas in the form of workshops and one-on-one training.
Course sites are created automatically for all courses each semester and become available to faculty immediately. Students can see their courses up to two weeks before classes start as long as the instructor has published the site. Canvas course sites are created for each individual section of a course. If the instructor wishes to combine all or some of the sections into one site, please send an email to the CIS Help Desk at <a href=""mailto:helpdesk@hmc.edu"">helpdesk@hmc.edu."
Classroom Technologies,"At HMC, there are several Class and Meeting Rooms that contain different levels of classroom technology. A list of these rooms and their technology can be found here: <a href=""http://goo.gl/4Mj1Nx"">AV Equipment in HMC Class/Meeting Rooms.
All classrooms in the Shanahan Center for Teaching and Learning (SCTL) have AV controls to enable a user to project from a VGA or HDMI source. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3M48dV5JsLVYUZqb2J4bGg1VDQ/view?usp=sharing"">User Guides are provided in each room to aid in the use of the room.
SCTL Technology Rich Classrooms (SCTL 2450, 2454, 2460) allow the Academic &amp; Research Computing Services Team (ARCS) to work with faculty and students on new technologies that we want to test at HMC. These rooms are designed to be flexible in their AV hardware, software, and control systems. If there are any technologies that you feel would be good to try in these rooms, please feel free to email the team at helpdesk@hmc.edu. Below are some additional technologies that can be found in these tech rich rooms.

Cognos Reporting: Account Management,"Account management is provided for Cognos users: Assigning privileges, capabilities, and access to Cognos reporting software and its various features."
Cognos Reporting: Training and Usage Support,Training and documentation are available to HMC faculty and staff Cognos users.
Cognos: Reporting Assistance Requests,"Reporting assistance is available to help refine and compose reports in Cognos. CIS also accepts reporting requests by providing the output of requested reports, and publishing them so that they can be run in the future, or scheduled and output to emails. Some reporting requests require collaboration with other departments."
Cognos: Maintenance and Publishing of Metadata,"Cognos can connect to many databases, but primarily it is used to report from CX, our Student Information System. Data is separated into packages and models based on departmental need, and then published for users use for reporting based on their security privileges. The structure, content and organization of the packages is maintained by CIS, and modifications and new content can be added as needed."
Computer Labs,"The Sprague computer lab, located on the 1st floor of the Norman F. Sprague Center, contains 7 M1 24-inch iMacs and 5 Dell Optiplex PCs available for use on a first-come, first-serve basis.
Systems in both labs are equipped with several academic software packages and applications used in courses. To request an application to be installed on the Mac and/or Windows platforms, please contact the CIS Help Desk."
Computer Upgrade Program,"The CIS computer upgrade program is one of the sources of new computer equipment at Harvey Mudd College, although not the sole source. The program was designed with several goals in mind:
Standardize computer equipment on campus.
Provide a baseline of adequate computing equipment to staff and faculty.
Ensure that computing equipment is refreshed on a regular basis.
Provide guidance for departmental purchases.
Potentially reduce costs by consolidating equipment purchases.
You can read about the <a href=""https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/cis-cup/home"">Computer Upgrade Program in detail."
Course Mailing Lists,"CIS provides several different methods for emailing the instructors and students in a particular course.
<a href=""http://groups.g.hmc.edu"">Google Groups
The <a href=""https://portal.hmc.edu"">HMC portal also includes a way for a faculty member to email all of the students in his/her class.
Sakai has an Email Archive tool which creates a mailing list."
Course and Personal Websites,"The Office of Communications and Marketing (part of the Office of College Advancement) manages the core HMC website (www.hmc.edu), and is dedicated to promoting the college via the website. To manage the HMC website, communications and marketing uses WordPress and works with department content editors to manage the main HMC website. If you want to place information on the main College website, please start by consulting with your department content editor.
There are several other website hosting options that CIS supports:
If you want a course or project site that is fully supported and puts lots of tools at your disposal, please consider Sakai, which is used Claremont wide. CIS provides full support for <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/sakai-support/"">Sakai.
If you want an easy to use system for creating websites for clubs, personal interests or other internal material we suggest you use the <a href=""https://sites.google.com/"">Google Workspace Sites tool on g.hmc.edu. You can limit access to these sites if you wish. CIS fully supports sites on g.hmc.edu.
If you want to provide static html sites without using Google sites, then <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/pages-hmc-edu/"">pages.hmc.edu is an option that we support.
If you want to develop active sites with languages like php, python or ruby on rails, or if you want a personal wordpress blog, then there are myriad hosting options. We recommend <a href=""http://www.dreamhost.com"">Dreamhost for several reasons: It is the hosting service being used for www.hmc.edu, it was founded by Mudd and CMC alums, and it is very flexible, powerful and reasonably priced. CIS can provide limited support to get you started with Dreamhost if you need it."
CX (Student Information System): Account Management,"CX software accounts can be created and managed by assigning privileges, capabilities, and granting access to CX and its various features"
CX (Student Information System): Data Import and Export,"Bulk updates can be imported and exported to/from CX. Examples: Communication between databases (Enrollment Manager, OnBase, PowerFaids) and from spreadsheets (Room Draw, Insurance Waivers)."
CX (Student Information System): Usage Support,"CX usage support includes installation and support of CX access software, such as QuickMate/Putty or CX Web Interface 8.1. CIS can also assist you in resolving problems with CX, and in modifications to CX menus and screens."
Data Management Plan (DMP) Support,"A data management plan is a document outlining how a researcher plans to manage data during and after a research project including how it will be organized, maintained and shared. More and more funding agencies are now requiring researchers to submit a formal data management plan (DMP) when applying for grants.
We recommend you to use <a href=""http://dmptool.org/"">DMPTool to create a DMP. For more information on creating a DMP, access to DMPTool and other resources, please refer to the <a href=""https://library.claremont.edu/research-data-management/"">Claremont Colleges Library page on research data management.
The Claremont Colleges Library is an institutional member of <a href=""https://datadryad.org/stash"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Dryad, a data repository which provides a platform to help make research data discoverable, freely reusable, and cite-able. Any researcher associated with the Claremont Colleges can deposit datasets from any discipline into Dryad at no cost. Dryad is one of many data repositories that can be used to share <a href=""https://library.claremont.edu/managing-research-data/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">rese<a href=""https://library.claremont.edu/managing-research-data/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">arch<a href=""https://library.claremont.edu/managing-research-data/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> data."
Digital Signage,"CIS supports the many digital signs around the HMC campus. The digital signs on campus use <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-sign-builder/odjaaghiehpobimgdjjfofmablbaleem"">Chrome Sign Builder. Departmental digital signs have a designated content manager responsible for the sign after deployment by CIS.
Signs can be used for displaying any number of pieces of content. Currently, we have signs that display today’s menu items, news, campus information, and much more."
Dorm WiFi and Ethernet Ports,"In accordance with the <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/about-cis/policies/dorm-network-resource-policy/"">Dorm Network Resource Policy, students staying in the dorms have access to the HMC Network through wired (ethernet) ports and via wireless.
One Port Per Pillow Policy
While CIS still makes wired ethernet ports available, the main focus is adequate WiFi coverage for all dorms. CIS has minimally allocated one wired port for each student in a dorm. Your dorm may have any number of ports dependent on how many students occupy it.
If you find yourself in a situation where you need additional network ports (for servers, game consoles, etc.) or better WiFi coverage please contact the CIS Help Desk for assistance. We can often help by changing configurations, adding temporary network equipment, or aiding you in the set up of a personal network device such as a switch or router/access point. For more information on personal network devices please read on here: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/13hJBgBVmnLJJJ3uO2Q2-0-W-RqVg0i82-Bselc9n3uE/pub"">Recommended Personal Switches, Routers, and Access Points"
Eduroam Wireless Roaming,"Eduroam (education wireless roaming) allows users (researchers, teachers, students, staff) from participating institutions to securely access the Internet from any Eduroam-enabled institution. In other words, your HMC credentials will work at other institutions to get you access to secure wireless networks and other resources. And, when visitors arrive in Claremont, they can use their own home institution credentials to access wireless here.
The Eduroam principle is based on the fact that the user’s authentication is done by the user’s home institution, whereas the authorization decision allowing access to the network resources is done by the visited network."
Email,"CIS provides faculty, students, and staff with Harvey Mudd College email accounts. Faculty, students, and staff are all given Google Workplace accounts for access to their entire Google Apps Suite. For the purpose of email, faculty and students will solely use Google Workplace. Staff are given Microsoft 365 accounts that work in conjunction with Outlook or the Outlook Web App (OWA) for their email use. Alumni retain their G Suite accounts indefinitely after graduation.
To aid with spam filtering, HMC uses Cisco IronPort in front of a user’s Google Workplace and Microsoft 365 account.
Due to HMC’s mixed service environment, a user is reachable by multiple email addresses.
Faculty and Students
username@hmc.edu
username@g.hmc.edu (Google Workspace)
Staff
username@hmc.edu
username@g.hmc.edu (Google Workspace)
username@m.hmc.edu (Microsoft 365)
CIS highly recommends giving out your @hmc.edu email address. However, you still may choose to use your service specific addresses. The only difference is how mail is routed to its final destination. The <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3M48dV5JsLVNEVITG5TZ0Q1Zms/edit?usp=sharing"">HMC Email Flow diagram explains how mail flow works at HMC when sending to these different addresses."
File Sharing,"File sharing allows users to collaborate, access and exchange files. CIS recommends the following options that are also self-service:
Google Drive – A cloud storage solution from Google. Unlimited storage with your g.hmc.edu account. All current staff, faculty, emeriti, and alumni maintain access to their G Suite.
Sakai – a course management and collaborative learning tool. This system serves faculty, staff and students of all seven Claremont Colleges and The Claremont Colleges Services."
&#8220;Footprints&#8221; Help Desk Ticket Tracking System,"“Footprints” is a ticket tracking system used by CIS to track help requests. Emailing <a href=""mailto:helpdesk@hmc.edu"">helpdesk@hmc.edu will create a new ticket. After creation, an automated reply is sent via email from “HMC CIS Support” to notify the customer that a ticket has been created, and similarly for all updates to the ticket. Customers can send updates to tickets by replying to the generated emails. Notification is sent when a ticket has been closed with the opportunity for feedback through a survey."
Formstack,"CIS offers a third party service called Formstack for fillable form creation. Formstack is an online HTML Form Builder that lets you create all types of online forms, such as order forms, contact forms, registration forms, and online surveys. We are no longer creating new accounts in Formstack."
Google Apps &#8211; Adding new features,"Google’s G Suite includes access to additional apps that can be turned on to obtain additional functionality. Some are free and some involve payment. Some can be turned on by individual users and some have to be turned on at an administrator level.
<a href=""https://apps.google.com/marketplace/"">Google Apps Marketplace provides access to apps that add extra functionality to existing Google Apps such as Docs, Drive, or Gmail. These can allow you to sort a Google Sheet by cell color, or add mathematics equations and graphs to a Google Doc, for example.
There are also some apps that must be activated by an administrator for the whole campus. Some examples of apps that CIS has activated using this method are Google Plus and Kissflow. CIS’s process for apps that require administrator activation is as follows:
We receive an activation request.
We test the app in production (usually testing involves at least CIS, but may include others)
We tell people we are going to turn on a new app.
We turn the app on.
We wait for concerns to be raised, if any."
Google Workplace,"CIS provides Google Workplace accounts to faculty, staff, students, and alumni of HMC. Google Workplace includes Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Sites and more!"
Google Groups Mailing Lists,"HMC uses Google Groups (a service included with Google Workplace) for both automated and non-automated mailing lists. We began creating new ad hoc lists in Google Groups several years ago. Starting in Fall 2015 we have also begun creating automated lists such as Course, Major, Dorm, and Class year lists with Google Groups. We also have a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16PrH0smdx8NJkno5OkWAEjnC5YPZIMLU5c237z4QJPA/edit?usp=sharing"">list of all automatically generated course mailing lists on Google Groups (HMC login is required).
With Google Groups, you can create online and email-based groups. There’s a lot you can do with Google Groups:
Engage in discussions about a specific subject.
Organize meetings, conferences, or social events among members of a group.
Find people with similar hobbies, interests, or backgrounds.
Read group posts through email, the online interface, or both.
You may also find the following videos helpful when getting started with Google Groups:

<a href=""https://youtu.be/_Y-K9J-2O6Q"">Video: Emailing Class and Departmental Lists Using Google Groups"
Gradescope,"Gradescope is an online grading platform that helps make grading faster, more consistent, and fairer. HMC has an institutional license for Gradescope which means faculty and students can sign up for accounts for free. Faculty also have access to all premium features in Gradescope including flexible rubrics, autograding of programming assignments, grouping similar answers, and integration with Sakai."
Hard Drive Encryption,"Hard drive encryption uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data on a hard drive. Data on an encrypted hard drive cannot be read by anyone who does not have access to the system, appropriate key, or password. It must be decrypted using that key or password to read encrypted data.
Encryption is best used on machines that can easily be lost or stolen, although there is no harm in encrypting all of your systems.
At HMC, CIS recommends encrypting your entire operating system volume through BitLocker for Windows computers, or FileVault for Apple computers. You will be given a unique recovery key during the encryption setup process. This key is needed to decrypt your hard drive if BitLocker or FileVault locks your system. BitLocker may activate on your system if there is an unexpected power outage, if you are replacing hardware components in your computer, or if you unplug your computer and move it to a different location.
In those scenarios, you will need the recovery key to decrypt your data. Please save your key somewhere safe (i.e., not on your computer). CIS recommends Google Drive, which is encrypted on Google’s servers, or any encrypted password manager, such as <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/lastpass/"">LastPass at HMC."
High Performance Computing Support,"CIS helps faculty and students find on and off-campus resources for High Performance Computing (HPC) needs in their research and teaching. The <a href=""https://access-ci.org/"">ACCESS (Advanced CyberinfrastructureCoordination Ecosystem: Services &amp; Support) is an NSF-funded project that gives access to a network of supercomputers located at institutions across the United States. CIS Academic and Research Computing Services (ARCS) team provides the following services:
Selecting the appropriate HPC resource.
Getting allocations on the computing resources made available by ACCESS.
Setting up the computing environment and workflow.
<a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/hpc-at-hmc/"">HPC Resources at Harvey Mudd College outlines other computing resources available at the college. For more information, please email the CIS Help Desk at <a href=""mailto:helpdesk@hmc.edu"">helpdesk@hmc.edu."
HMC Credentials,"With the launch of our <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/it-matters/iamhmc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Identity and Access Management (IAM) initiative, CIS introduced the concept of “HMC Credentials.” The term refers to the combination of your HMC User ID and HMC Password. As the initiative proceeds, more and more systems will start using HMC credentials. See <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MWw-VV-bGUYJ2_WtEzoWIz8rY55yYda58R8aog0sZbc/edit"">which services currently use HMC Credentials.
This represents a change in CIS communications and practices. Up to now, we have typically identified usernames and passwords by reference to the application or server which uses them, so we would often say things like “Google Apps username and password” or “LDAP username and password” and “Sakai username and password.” From now on, CIS will no longer refer to these local account credentials unless they are different from your HMC credentials.
Some of the services using HMC credentials can be accessed using Single Sign-On (SSO). For these services, such as G Suite and the Portal, you will only need to log in once to be able to access all other SSO services. See the list of Roles and Authorizations in the Related Links below to see which account types use which credentials.
CIS staff will never ask for the password associated with your HMC credentials. (See <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zja7O_61L9gc5eu7DknK4d-ro8hbD9K0aHzBM4Yu7Bs/edit?usp=sharing"">How do I reset my password?)"
iClickers,"iClickers are a personal response system that can be used for a variety of purposes in the classroom: review sessions, feedback on the pace of the class, etc. The iClickers use a wireless receiver to record student votes. Software on the instructor’s laptop records the votes and can display graphs of the distribution of votes. Students can receive points for participation and/or the correctness of their responses. Grading information can be exported and uploaded into Sakai, for example. See the <a href=""http://www.iclicker.com"">iClickers website for more information.
CIS has a number of sets of iClickers for use in the classroom and in meetings. Faculty can check out iClickers for the semester or for a single class. CIS also provides training on how to use the iClickers and will also install and configure the software. ARCS can also provide consultations on how to incorporate the iClickers into your syllabus."
Kuali Build,"Kuali Build is a code-free, cloud-based SaaS (software as a service) application development platform with business process management functionality. Kuali offers an intuitive and simple way for anyone to create their own forms and workflows using rich, powerful, automated, integrated business applications that are secure, accessible, and mobile-ready.
What can you do with Kuali?Transform your current process and create forms and workflows with integrations that:
Collect feedback and business information
Notify users&nbsp;
Create approval pathways
Enable a responsive user experience"
Lab Software in CIS Managed Labs and Carts,"CIS maintains a list of software that is installed on the systems in the Sprague 1st Floor Lab, Linde Activities Center Lab and Laptop Carts.
Each summer, CIS will update the list with newly installed software based on feedback from the HMC community."
Laptop Cart Reservation,"CIS manages three laptop carts with a total of 30 laptops. Each cart contains 10 laptops.
The laptops are macOS based systems. The systems are configured in the same manner as CIS Lab Systems. Here is a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-H67Vjx3G1fN0U2Lg2MwxaX7WqneTHTy4jUN30LaZw/pub"">list of all software loaded on the laptops.
We do our best to meet all requests, and have been able to meet all requests so far because faculty have considered how many systems are actually needed, and therefore have been flexible with the quantity of laptops requested.
In addition to the carts, there are three laptops dedicated to the Technology Rich Classrooms (SCTL 2450, 2454, 2460) intended for instructor use."
LastPass,"<a href=""http://www.lastpass.com/"">LastPass is a cloud-based password manager that allows users to store website credentials, notes, and other data in a secure and convenient manner. You can use LastPass to generate and store a complex password for your <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/hmc-credentials/"">HMC credentials, or any other logins you use for Mudd or non-Mudd related services."
Lecture Capture,"CIS uses the Mediasite lecture capture system to record audio and video of the speaker as well as screen capture of whatever is projected to the display. The recordings are distributed through our course management system, Sakai, unless otherwise requested. We have 8 classrooms in the Shanahan Center that are set up to automatically do lecture capture: Shanahan 1430 (Lecture Hall), Shanahan B480 (Recital Hall), B442, B460, 2450, 2454, 2460 and 3460. Lecture capture is also available in all three Galileo Auditoria (Pryne, McAlister and Edwards).
All recordings will remain on Mediasite’s servers until the end of the semester, when they will then be moved into USS’s video archive on Google Drive. At this point, you won’t be able to view the recorded videos without requesting a new video link from USS. Upon request, recordings can also be left on Mediasite for one additional semester. If you need a video hosted for more than two semesters, USS can work with you to preemptively transfer your video from Mediasite to Google Drive so that you can update your video links with no loss of hosting time.
Other features of Mediasite lecture capture include the ability to embed questions in a recording, quickly locate specific sections of a recording by searching text on slides, and a flexible player layout."
Lightboard,"The Lightboard is an interactive whiteboard that allows a user to draw upon the glass surface and speak to their audience without having to turn their back on them. The setup consists of the Lightboard, a video camera, and a wireless microphone, all of which will be in the room for the user. Simply press the Record button on the camera, turn on the wireless microphone transmitter and receiver, and begin the lesson.
Once the recording is complete the video will need to be flipped around so that the drawn image/text appears correctly for viewers. This is a fairly simple process and can be done easily with free software."
Loaner Program,"The CIS Help Desk maintains an inventory of equipment intended for short-term loans to the HMC community including Mac and PC laptops, tablets, iPads, video cameras, flash drives, and presentation equipment. Equipment can be requested by faculty, staff, and students for academic and administrative work in cases of personal computer failure, exploring new technology for instructional purposes, and presentations."
Microsoft 365,"CIS offers Microsoft 365 accounts to staff for e-mail and calendaring. Accounts can be added to Outlook and provide identical functionality as a traditional Exchange account. Microsoft 365’s web interface can be accessed from most modern browsers and mobile devices. Since Microsoft 365 is a cloud based service, accounts can easily be accessed anywhere."
Microsoft 365 Education for Students,"Harvey Mudd College uses Microsoft 365 which gives students access to Microsoft 365 Education for Students.
It allows access to the Microsoft Office Suite of Applications for free to students who are enrolled at HMC."
Mudd Shots,The Mudd Shots websites contains student photos for each dorm and graduating year at HMC. Course Mudd Shots has moved to the HMC Portal. The HMC Portal version includes photos of non-HMC students registered for the course. These photos are provided so that students and faculty can get to know the names and faces of other students.
Name Changes,"HMC distinguishes between legal name changes and campus name changes.  Your campus name is the name you wish to be known by on campus. You can read a detailed description of both on the Student Life <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/diversity/resources-for-transgender-students/"">Resources for Transgender Students  page. Students who wish to change either their legal name or their campus name should contact the Registrar’s Office. Faculty and staff who wish to change either their legal name or their campus name should contact the Human Resources Office. In both cases, the Registrar or Human Resources Office will contact CIS to make the necessary changes across all system accounts. In most cases those changes will happen automatically, but on some systems, such as Sakai or HMC WordPress, the changes will need to be done manually.
Since it is costly and complicated to do so, CIS does not typically change usernames.  Nowadays, system usernames are far less obvious than system display names in most applications.  However, faculty, staff, and students can request a username change when a legal name change makes it necessary. We will need to coordinate more closely with you in this case since we will need to coordinate the change across systems, particularly systems that require a manual update."
Ninjio,Ninjio is a cybersecurity awareness training solution that uses 3 – 4 minute long videos and infographics to discuss various security topics. The videos and infographics are aimed at sharing information about security topics in an effort to increase awareness and safe computing.

Online Form Builders,"Online form builders allow the user to create and deliver web-based forms. Though there are a variety of free or paid tools for creating online forms, CIS supports two main platforms: Kuali and Google Forms (an application in Google Workplace). While these tools are approximately equivalent for simple applications such as satisfaction surveys or RSVP forms, we have specific recommendations based on the purpose and design of the form.
CIS offered a third party service called Formstack for fillable form creation, but it won’t be supported after August 2023. We are offering help in training and transferring forms from Formstack to Kuali for those that require it. Please contact the <a href=""mailto:helpdeck@hmc.edu"">helpdeck@hmc.edu to setup an appointment if needed.
In general, we recommend using Google Forms for simple or informal surveys on campus. These forms are fairly easy to build and distribute, and they have many of the same capabilities of Kuali. 
Easy/limited requirements = Google Forms
Medium = Kuali
Other = OnBase or Microsoft Forms
You should use Kuali when:
The form will display information from other HMC data sources
The form will require heavy use of form logic, i.e. changing the content or organization of the form depending on user responses
You should use Google Forms when:
The form will be fairly simple (no form logic or payment information required)
You want to edit the form collaboratively with other users
You want to limit form access to HMC users or record the HMC usernames of form respondents
If you are planning to use forms for formal academic research, it may be worth purchasing an account with Qualtrics or another survey tool provider. While CIS does not provide Qualtrics accounts, individuals or small groups may acquire these accounts independently. Please consult with the <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/institutional-research/about-the-office-of-institutional-research-and-effectiveness/"">Office of Institutional Research and Effectiveness for further recommendations.
If you are using online forms to capture data that is FERPA protected, please be cognizant of how the data is stored and shared with other users. Not all forms or form builders will necessarily be FERPA compliant. For more information on FERPA, please contact the <a href=""https://www.hmc.edu/registrar/"">Office of the Registrar."
Online Instructional Resources (Lynda),"<a href=""https://www.lynda.com/"">Lynda.com is an online video library of courses for business, technology and creative skills. Mudd faculty, students and staff may find courses on web accessibility, Linux, Advanced Excel or Github of interest."
OpenDNS Umbrella,"OpenDNS Umbrella is a new network security service that was recently purchased by the Claremont Colleges as part of an ongoing effort to improve the security of network services. If you’re connected to the wireless network or the campus wired network and you, or your computer without your knowledge, attempt to connect to a known malicious site, you will be redirected to a warning page. The article <a href=""https://www.opendns.com/enterprise-security/threat-enforcement/"">Enterprise Threat Detection Like no Other has more information.
OpenDNS Umbrella works by examining requests from computers and other devices, determining if the requested site is in its database of known malicious sites and, if it is, redirecting to a benign web page. OpenDNS Umbrella does not capture information that is not already captured in router and switch logs. The kinds of problems it helps with include:
Botnets – software that makes your computer part of a “botnet” or network of computers that can be activated to attack other sites on the internet
Ransomware – a type of malware that encrypts the files on your computer and leaves a message offering to give you the key to decrypt the file in return for a sum of money. This kind of attack has been in the news lately, and HMC and the other Claremont Colleges have already been subject to Ransomware attacks.
Phishing – emails may contain requests for you to visit a site that contains malware, ransomware or botnet software. OpenDNS Umbrella prevents access to such sites.
‘Drive-by-download’ attacks – a malware delivery technique that is triggered simply because the user visited a website that contains codes delivered via content like banners or advertisements. The simple act of visiting a malicious site can be enough to get your computer infected or your personal details stolen."
Pages.hmc.edu,"Pages.hmc.edu is the name of a server maintained by CIS where HMC faculty, students and staff can host static HTML web pages."
Password and Account Management,The Rapid Identity Portal enables users to manage their HMC Credentials. The RI Portal will let you reset or change your password and set up security questions should you forget your password.
Piazza,Piazza is a popular alternative to the Sakai Forums tool with a lot more functionality. Its main use is as a tool for managing student questions. Students can work collaboratively to answer both student- and instructor-posed questions. You can also create announcements and quick polls as well as post content to the Resources section. HMC recently purchased a site license for Piazza.
Portal: Faculty Usage,"The HMC Portal allows faculty, students, and staff to view and modify CX data through a web browser. CX is the enterprise information system used by HMC and the other undergraduate Claremont Colleges for storing and managing most student and other college data.
Among other things, faculty can use Portal to view their class lists, manage permissions for students trying to add their classes, submit grades, and monitor their advisees. Faculty can also submit ‘academic advisories’ to notify students, their advisors, and administrators about a student’s performance in their course. Please note that Portal accounts for incoming students are created in early June of the year they matriculate.
After <a href=""http://portal.hmc.edu/"">logging into the Portal using your HMC credentials, click on the ‘Faculty’ tab in the upper left. You can enter grades by using the ‘My Courses’ portlet in the center of the page. The advisee section is located to the right in the ‘Advisee Roster’ portlet.

There is a single instance of Sakai which is managed by Pomona College. CIS provides support for Sakai including help with accounts and passwords as well consultation on how and when to use specific Sakai tools, help on how to use specific tools, and training on Sakai in the form of workshops and one-on-one training.
Sakai accounts for incoming students are generally created at the beginning of June when the various Sakai sites for incoming students become available. Course sites are created automatically for all courses each semester and become available to students two weeks before classes start. A full description of our policies regarding the creation of course sites and populating them with students and faculty is described in our <a href=""https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/site/!gateway/page/!gateway-200"">Sakai Policy document.
Sakai course sites are created for each individual section of a course. If the instructor wishes to combine all or some of the sections into one site, please send an email to the CIS Help Desk at helpdesk@hmc.edu."
Smartboard,"The Smartboard is an interactive display that allow users to work (e.g., writing, zooming, panning and flicking) on digital content (e.g. slides, PDFs, images, and videos) on the screen using their fingertips and digital markers. Everything written and imported on the whiteboard software can be captured and reused later.
CIS has a SMART Board 8070i which features 70″ HD LCD flat panel display with fully integrated Smartboard technology including surface object tracking cameras and whiteboard software (e.g. Smart Ink and Smart Notebook). It is mounted on a heavy duty mobile cart and is currently located in one of our technology-rich classrooms.

Wireless Networks,"Claremont-WPA (HMC credentials or people from The Claremont Colleges)
Claremont-WPA is the preferred wireless network at HMC. Connecting to Claremont-WPA provides the benefits of WPA2-Enterprise security and allows for accessing most internal HMC resources. It requires authentication with your HMC credentials username followed by @hmc.edu and HMC credentials password upon connection.
For most devices, you should only need to enter your HMC username followed by @hmc.edu and your HMC password. If connecting to Claremont-WPA with an Android device, it may ask for additional information:
EAP method: PEAP
Phase 2 authentication: MSCHAPv2
System certificate: “Do not verify” or “Use system certificate”
Domain: hmc.edu
Identity: Your HMC username followed by @hmc.edu
Anonymous identity: Leave blank
Password: Your HMC password
Eduroam (guest network for people from other institutions)
Eduroam (education wireless roaming) allows users (researchers, teachers, students, staff) from participating institutions to securely access the Internet from any Eduroam-enabled institution. In other words, your HMC credentials will work at other institutions to get you access to secure wireless networks and other resources. It requires authentication with your HMC credentials username followed by @hmc.edu and HMC credentials password upon connection. If you are visiting from another campus, you will need to enter your home campus credentials.
The Eduroam principle is based on the fact that the user’s authentication is done by the user’s home institution, whereas the authorization decision allowing access to the network resources is done by the visited network. A full list of participating institutions can be found on <a href=""https://www.eduroam.us/institutions_list"">Eduroam’s website.
Claremont-ETC (older devices and guests who can’t use Eduroam)
The Claremont-ETC wireless network is designed for use by older devices that do not support WPA2-Enterprise authentication. The Claremont-ETC network is inherently less secure because it involves a shared password.  Do not use Claremont-ETC if you can use Claremont-WPA or Eduroam instead.
If you have HMC credentials and need to connect to Claremont-ETC please use our <a href=""https://forms.gle/RqcEGQQe44ecE7nBA"">Claremont-ETC Password Request form (you must be signed into your @g.hmc.edu to view it). If you don’t have HMC credentials please contact the CIS Help Desk to obtain the current password."
Wireless Projection,"Wireless Projection allows a user to display content from their device, either a laptop or mobile device, to a projection or LCD screen without the use of cables. This allows the user to have the freedom to walk around a room or easily share screen access to other users in the room. As part of CIS’s continuing Wireless projection pilot, AppleTVs and Microsoft WiDi adapters are available in a few select rooms across campus to enable wireless projection. We’ve found that using both of these devices covers the vast majority of users and their devices.
The following rooms currently contain wireless project devices:
AppleTV (compatible with Apple devices):
Shanahan 2450
Shanahan 2454
Caryll Mudd Sprague Private Dining Room (Hoch-Shanahan)
Microsoft WiDi (compatible with Windows and Android devices):
Shanahan 2460
Janet &amp; Jeffery Mitchell ’79 Private Dining Room (Hoch-Shanahan)
The list is expected to grow, so be sure to check the current list of <a href=""http://goo.gl/4Mj1Nx"">AV Equipment in the HMC Class/Meeting Rooms page for up-to-date information on equipped rooms.
